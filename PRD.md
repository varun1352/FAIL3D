# 3D to DXF Converter - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** 3D-to-DXF Converter
**Timeline:** 48-hour hackathon
**Goal:** Create an MVP that converts 3D models (STL/OBJ) into CAD-compatible 2D drawings (DXF)

## 1. Product Vision

Create a web-based tool that allows mechanical engineers and designers to quickly convert 3D models into properly formatted 2D technical drawings suitable for further CAD editing, manufacturing documentation, and production processes.

## 2. Target Users

- Mechanical engineers
- Product designers
- CAD technicians
- Manufacturing engineers
- Rapid prototyping specialists

## 3. User Stories

1. **As a** mechanical engineer, **I want to** convert my 3D prototype model into a 2D drawing, **so that** I can finalize technical documentation.
2. **As a** product designer, **I want to** generate standardized orthographic views of my 3D model, **so that** I can share them with manufacturing teams.
3. **As a** CAD technician, **I want to** quickly create 2D representations of 3D parts, **so that** I can modify them in my preferred CAD software.
4. **As a** manufacturing engineer, **I want to** extract exact dimensions from a 3D model, **so that** I can create production documentation.

## 4. MVP Feature Requirements

  - FreeCAD
  - Other standard CAD software

## 6. Architecture Overview

### 6.1 System Components
1. **Web Interface** - For file upload and result delivery
2. **File Processor** - For validating and handling uploaded files
3. **3D Processing Engine** - For model analysis and feature extraction
4. **2D Conversion Module** - For projection and view generation
5. **DXF Generator** - For creating the final output file

### 6.2 Data Flow
1. User uploads STL/OBJ file
2. System validates file format and size
3. 3D processing engine analyzes the model
4. System generates orthographic projections
5. System identifies and creates dimensions
6. DXF generator creates the output file
7. User downloads the resulting DXF

## 7. MVP Scope Limitations

The following features are explicitly **OUT OF SCOPE** for the 48-hour MVP:

- Multiple sheet layouts
- Custom views beyond standard orthographic projections
- Advanced annotations (GD&T symbols, surface finishes, etc.)
- Bill of Materials (BOM) generation
- Assembly drawings (only single parts)
- Automatic section views
- Drawing revision management
- Cloud storage of models/drawings

## 8. Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. It successfully processes standard STL/OBJ files up to 100k triangles
2. It generates dimensionally accurate orthographic views
3. It produces DXF files that can be opened and edited in standard CAD software
4. The web interface allows for simple file upload and download
5. Processing time stays within reasonable limits for demo purposes

## 9. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

While out of scope for the initial 48-hour MVP, the following enhancements would be considered for future development:

1. Support for additional 3D formats (STEP, IGES, etc.)
2. Custom view angles and projections
3. Automatic detection of manufacturing features
4. Section view generation
5. GD&T symbol support
6. Multiple drawing sheet layouts
7. Assembly drawing support
8. Integration with cloud storage services
9. Material and finish annotations
10. Export to additional 2D formats (PDF, SVG, etc.)

## 10. Technical Implementation Notes

### Processing Pipeline

The implemented solution should follow this general pipeline:

1. **Model Loading** - Load and validate the 3D model
2. **Orientation Analysis** - Determine the model's axes
3. **Feature Detection** - Identify key geometric features
4. **View Generation** - Project to standard orthographic planes
5. **Edge Processing** - Determine visible and hidden edges
6. **Dimensioning** - Add dimensions to key features
7. **DXF Generation** - Create properly structured DXF file

### Key Algorithms

1. **Edge Detection** - Algorithm to extract edges from mesh data
2. **Projection** - Methods for accurate 3D to 2D projection
3. **Feature Recognition** - Basic algorithms to identify holes, fillets, etc.
